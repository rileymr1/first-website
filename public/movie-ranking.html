<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lego Batman Movie</h3>
<p>
  This movie is funny, there's lots of inside jokes about batman lore, and it's
  about a loner learning to love a family again.
</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  Again, incredibly well-written and paced film with excellent performances and
  themes.
</p>
<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>
  A perfect film. Story, writing, everything. And perfect timing with my own
  childhood.
